* This is a new release.
* The tests rely on a large database which is not included in the package, and therefore they are skipped on CRAN. Note that the package is well tested - there are more than 1400 tests which are run before any release. In addition, there are examples on every function that are being invoked on CRAN.
* This submission fixes the NOTE regarding ivalid URI in news.md.
