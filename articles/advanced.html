<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Naryn allows efficient access and analysis of medical records that are maintained in a custom database.</p>
<p>Naryn can work under R (as a package) or Python (as a module). The vast majority of the functions and the concepts are shared between the two implementations, yet certain differences still exist and are summarized in a table below. Code examples and function names in this document are presented for R but they can equally run in Python with the interface changes as to the table.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="db-dirs-namespaces-and-read-only-tracks">DB dirs, Namespaces and Read-Only Tracks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#db-dirs-namespaces-and-read-only-tracks"></a>
</h3>
<p>Naryn allows accessing the data that resides in <em>tracks</em> where each track holds certain type of medical data such as patients’ diagnoses or their hemoglobin level at certain points of time. The track files can be aggregated from one or more directories. Before the tracks can be accessed, Naryn needs to establish connection to the directories, also referred as <em>db dirs</em>. Call <code>emr_db.connect</code> function to establish the access to the tracks in the db_dirs. To establish a connection using <code>emr_db.connect</code>, Naryn requires to specify at-least one db dir. Optionally, <code>emr_db.connect</code> accepts additional db dirs which can also contain additional tracks. In a case where 2 or more db dirs contain the same track name (namespace collision), the track will be taken from the db dir which was passed <em>last</em> in the order of connections. For example, if we have 2 db dirs <code>/db1</code> and <code>/db2</code> which both contain a track named <code>track1</code>, the call <code>emr_db.connect(c('/db1', '/db2'))</code> will result with Naryn using <code>track1</code> from <code>/db2</code>. As you might expect the overriding is consistent not only for the track’s data itself, but also for any other Naryn entity using or pointing to the track.</p>
<p>Even though all db directories may contain track files, their designation is different. All the db dirs except for the last dir in the order of connections are mainly read-only. The directory which was connected last in the order, is termed <em>user dir</em>, and is intended to store volatile data like the results of intermediate calculations. New tracks can be created only in the db dir which was last in the order of connections, using <code>emr_track.import</code> or <code>emr_track.create</code>. In order to write tracks to a db dir which is not last in the connection order, you must explicitly pass the path to the required db dir, and this should be done for a well justified reason.</p>
<p>A track may be marked as read-only to prevent its accidental deletion or modification. Use <code>emr_track.readonly</code> to set or get read-only property of the track. A newly created tracks is always writable. If you wish to mark it as “read-only”, please do it in a separate call.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="load-on-demand-vs--pre-load-modes">Load-on-demand vs. Pre-load Modes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#load-on-demand-vs--pre-load-modes"></a>
</h3>
<p><code>emr_db.connect</code> supports two modes of work - ‘load on demand’ and ‘pre-load’. In ‘load on demand’ mode tracks are loaded into memory only when they are accessed. Tracks stay in the memory up until R sessions ends or the package is unloaded (Python: since modules cannot be forced to unload, <code>db_unload</code> is introduced).</p>
<p>In ‘pre-load’ mode, all the tracks are pre-loaded into memory making subsequent track access significantly faster. As loaded tracks reside in shared memory, other R sessions running on the same machine may also enjoy significant run-time boost. On the flip side, pre-loading all the tracks prolongs the execution of <code>emr_db.connect</code> and requires enough memory to accommodate all the data.</p>
<p>Choosing between the two modes depends on the specific needs. While <code>load_on_demand=TRUE</code> seems to be a solid default choice, in an environment where there are frequent short-living R sessions, each accessing a track, one might opt for running a “daemon” - an additional permanent R session. The daemon would pre-load all the tracks in advance and stay alive thus boosting the run-time of the later emerging sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="maintaining-database">Maintaining Database<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#maintaining-database"></a>
</h3>
<p>Naryn caches certain data on the disk to maintain fast run-times. In particular two files (<code>.naryn</code> and <code>.ids</code>) are created in any database, and another file called <code>.logical_tracks</code> is created in global databases.</p>
<p><code>.naryn</code> file contains a list of all tracks in the current root directory and their last modification dates. This file spares a full root directory rescan when <code>emr_db.connect</code> is called. The recorded modification dates allow to efficiently synchronize the track changes induced by synchronously running R sessions.</p>
<p><code>.logical_tracks</code> implements the same mechanism for logical tracks, which store their properties (source and values) under a folder called <code>logical</code>.</p>
<p><code>.ids</code> file contains available ids that are used to run certain types of <em>track expression iterators</em> (see below). The source of these ids comes from a `patients.dob} (i.e. Date Of Birth) track, which must be present in the global root directory before these iterators may be utilized.</p>
<p>Various functions such as <code>emr_track.import</code> modify these files according to the changes that DB undergoes (addition / removal / modification of tracks). Thus manual (outside of Naryn) modification, replacement, addition or deletion of track files cause the cache files to go out of sync. Various problems might arise as a consequence, such as run-time errors, out-dated data from modified tracks and sub-optimal run-time performance.</p>
<p>Manual modifications of the database files can still be performed, yet they must be ratified by running <code>emr_db.reload</code>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="file-and-directory-permissions">File and directory permissions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#file-and-directory-permissions"></a>
</h4>
<p>Naryn creates files and directories with a umask of <code>007</code> (except for read-only tracks), which means that files and directories would have permissions of <code>660 (rw-rw----)</code> and <code>770 (rwxrwx---)</code> respectively. This means that in order to access a database that someone outside the group created, the file and folder permissions need to be changed first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="tracks">Tracks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tracks"></a>
</h3>
<p>Each track is stored in a binary file with <code>.nrtrack</code> file extension. One of the two internal formats, <em>dense</em> or <em>sparse</em>, is automatically selected during the track creation. The choice of the exact format is based on the optimal run-time performance.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="records-and-references">Records and References<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#records-and-references"></a>
</h4>
<p><em>Track</em> is a data structure that stores a set of records of <code>(id, time, ref, numeric value)</code> type. For example, hemoglobin level of patients can be stored in this way, where <code>id</code> would be the id of the patient and <code>time</code> would indicate the moment when the blood test was made. Another track can contain the code of the laboratory which carried out the test. If the times of the records from the two tracks match, one would conclude which lab performed the given test.</p>
<p>Time resolution is always in hours. It might happen that two different blood tests are carried out by two different labs for the same patient at the same hour. Assuming that each lab has certain bias due to different equipment used, the reads of the hemoglobin might come out different. Since both of the tests are carried out at exactly the same hour it will be impossible later to link each result to the lab that performed it.</p>
<p>In those cases when two or more values share identical <code>id</code> and <code>time</code> Naryn requires them to use then different <code>ref</code> (<em>references</em>). A reference is an integer number in the range of [-1, 254], which when no time collision occurs is normally set to -1. However, in cases of ambiguity it can give additional resolution to the time. In our blood example the results of the first lab could have been recorded with <code>ref = 0</code> and the second lab would do it with <code>ref = 1</code>. This way the two hemoglobin readings could later be separated and correctly linked to their originating labs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="categorical-and-quantitative-tracks">Categorical and Quantitative Tracks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#categorical-and-quantitative-tracks"></a>
</h4>
<p>Tracks store numerical values assigned to the patients and times. The numerical data however can have different meaning and hence impose different set of operations to be applied to it. Laboratory codes, diagnosis codes, binary information such as date of birth or doctor visits are one type of data which we call <em>categorical</em>. Another type of data indicate usually the readings of different instruments such as the heartbeat rate or glucose level. This type of data is called <em>quantitative</em>.</p>
<p>The operations that can be applied to both of these types can be very different. One might want to search for the specific diagnosis code, yet it makes little sense to search for the very specific heartbeat rate, say “68”. On contrary heartbeat rate readings from different times can be averaged or a mean value might be calculated - something that has no meaning in case of categorical data.</p>
<p>During the track creation one must specify the type of the track: categorical or quantitative. Various operations that can be later applied to the track are bound to the track type.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="logical-tracks">Logical tracks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#logical-tracks"></a>
</h4>
<p>In addition to the physical tracks which are stored in the binary files, <code>naryn</code> supports a concept of a <em>logical track</em> which is an alias to a physical track. For example, assume we have a track called <code>lab.103</code> which contains hemoglobin levels of patients. It would be more convenient to refer to it explicitly by <code>hemoglobin</code> instead of remembering the lab code. <em>Logical tracks</em> do exactly this, we can create a logical track called <code>hemoglobin</code> which refers to the physical <code>lab.103</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/emr_track.logical.create.html">emr_track.logical.create</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"hemoglobin"</span>, <span class="st">"lab.103"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/emr_extract.html">emr_extract</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"hemoglobin"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <em>logical tracks</em> to create an alias for specific values from a <em>categorical</em> track. For example, suppose we have a track called <code>diagnosis.250</code> which contains the diagnosis times of ICD code 250 (“<em>250.*</em>”), with the values being the sub-diagnosis (e.g. <code>1</code> for 250.1 and <code>4</code> for 250.4). <em>Logical tracks</em> allow us to create an alias for a specific sub-diagnosis value and then refer to it as a regular track:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/emr_track.logical.create.html">emr_track.logical.create</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"dx.250.1_4"</span>, <span class="st">"diagnosis.250"</span>, values <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span>,<span class="fl">4</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/emr_extract.html">emr_extract</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"dx.250.1_4"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the hood logical tracks are implemented using the virtual tracks mechanism (see below), but unlike virtual tracks - they are part of the database and are persistent between sessions. You can delete a logical track by calling <code>emr_track.logical.rm</code> and list them using <code>emr_track.logical.ls</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="track-attributes">Track Attributes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#track-attributes"></a>
</h4>
<p>In addition to numeric data a track may store arbitrary meta-data such as description, source, etc. The meta-data is stored in the form of name-value pairs or attributes where the value is a character string.</p>
<p>Though not officially enforced attributes are intended to store relatively short character strings. Please use <em>track variables</em> to store data in any other format.</p>
<p>A single attribute can be retrieved, added, modified or deleted using <code>emr_track.attr.get</code> and <code>emr_track.attr.set</code> functions. Bulk access to more than one attribute is facilitated by <code>emr_track.attr.export</code> function.</p>
<p>Track names which attributes values match a pattern can be retrieved using <code>emr_track.ls</code>, <code>emr_track.global.ls</code> and <code>emr_track.user.ls</code> functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="track-variables">Track Variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#track-variables"></a>
</h4>
<p>Track statistics, results of time-consuming per-track calculations, historical data and any other data in arbitrary format can be stored in a track’s supplementary data in the form of track variables. Track variable can be retrieved, added, modified or deleted using <code>emr_track.var.get</code>, <code>emr_track.var.set</code> and <code>emr_track.var.rm</code> functions. List of track variables can be retrieved using <code>emr_track.var.ls</code> function.</p>

<h4 id="subsets">Subsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#subsets"></a>
</h4>
<p>The analysis of data often involves dividing the data to train and test sets. Naryn allows to subset the data via <code>emr_db.subset</code> function. <code>emr_db.subset</code> accepts a list of ids or samples the ids randomly. These ids constitute the subset. The ids that are not in the subset are skipped by all the <em>iterators</em>, <em>filters</em> and various functions.</p>
<p>One may think of a subset as an additional layer, a “viewport”, that filters out some of the ids. Some lower-level functions such as <code>emr_track.info</code> or <code>emr_track.unique</code> ignore the subsets. Same applies to <code>percentile.*</code> functions of the virtual tracks.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-1"></a>
</h4>
<p><em>Track expression</em> allows to retrieve numerical data that is recorded in the tracks. Track expressions are widely used in various functions (<code>emr_screen</code>, <code>emr_extract</code>, <code>emr_dist</code>, …).</p>
<p>Track expression is a character string that closely resembles a valid R/Python expression. Just like any other R/Python expression it may include conditions, function calls and variables defined beforehand. <code>"1 &gt; 2"</code>, <code>"mean(1:10)"</code> and <code>"myvar &lt; 17"</code> are all valid track expressions. Unlike regular R/Python expressions track expression might also contain track names and / or <em>virtual track</em> names.</p>
<p>To understand how the track expression allows the access to the tracks we must explain how the track expression gets evaluated.</p>
<p>Every track expression is accompanied by an <em>iterator</em> that produces a set of <em>id-time points</em> of <code>(id, time, ref)</code> type. For each each iterator point the track expression is evaluated. The value of the track expression <code>"mean(1:10)"</code> is constant regardless the iterator point. However the track expression might contain a track name <code>mytrack</code>, like: <code>"mytrack * 3"</code>. Naryn recognizes then that <code>mytrack</code> is not a regular R/Python variable but rather a track name. A new <em>run-time track variable</em> named <code>mytrack</code> is added then to R environment (or Python module local dictionary). For each iterator point this variable is assigned the value of the track that matches <code>(id, time, ref)</code> (or NaN if no matching value exists in the track). Once <code>mytrack</code> is assigned the corresponding value, the track expression is evaluated in R/Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="run-time-track-variable-is-a-vector">Run-time Track Variable is a Vector<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#run-time-track-variable-is-a-vector"></a>
</h4>
<p>To boost the performance of the track expression evaluation, run-time track variables are actually defined as vectors in R rather than scalars. The result of the evaluation is expected to be also a vector of a similar size. One should always keep in his mind the vectorial notation and write the track expressions accordingly.</p>
<p>For example, at first glance a track expression <code>"min(mytrack, 10)"</code> seems to be perfectly fine. However the evaluation of this expression produces always a scalar, i.e. a single number even if <code>mytrack</code> is actually a vector. The way to correct the specific track expression so that it works on vectors, is to use <code>pmin</code> function instead of <code>min</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to R, a track variable in Python is not a scalar but rather an instance of <code>numpy.ndarray</code>. The evaluation of a track expression must therefore produce a <code>numpy.ndarray</code> as well. Various operations on numpy arrays indeed work the same way as with scalars, however logical operations require different syntax. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>screen(<span class="st">"mytrack1 &gt; 1 and mytrack2 &lt; 2"</span>, iterator <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"mytrack1"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will produce an error given that <code>mytrack1</code> and <code>mytrack2</code> are numpy arrays. The correct way to write the expression is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>screen(<span class="st">"(mytrack1 &gt; 1) &amp; (mytrack2 &lt; 2)"</span>, iterator<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"mytrack1"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>One may coerce the track variable to behave like a scalar: by setting <code>emr_eval.buf.size</code> option to <code>1</code> (see Appendix for more details). Beware though that this might take its heavy toll on run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="matching-reference-in-the-track-expression">Matching Reference in the Track Expression<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matching-reference-in-the-track-expression"></a>

<p>If the track expression contains a track (or virtual track) name, then the values from the track are fetched one-by-one into the identically named R variable based on <code>id</code>, <code>time</code> and <code>ref</code> of the iterator point. If however <code>ref</code> of the iterator point equals to <code>-1</code>, we treat it as a “wildcard”: matching is required then only for <code>id</code> and <code>time</code>.</p>
<p>“Wildcard” reference in the iterator might create a new issue: more than one track value might match then a single iterator point. In this case the value placed in the track variable (e.g. <code>mytrack</code>) depends on the type of the track. If the track is categorical the track variable is set to <code>-1</code>, otherwise it is set to the average of all matching values.</p>

<h4 id="virtual-tracks">Virtual Tracks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#virtual-tracks"></a>
</h4>
<p>So far we have shown that in some situations <code>mytrack</code> variable can be set to the average of the matching track values. But what if we do not want to average the values but rather pick up the maximal, minimal or median value? What if we want to use the percentile of a track value rather than the value itself? And maybe we even want to alter the time of the iterator point: shift it or expand to a time window and by that look at the different set of track values? For instance: given an iterator point we might want to know what was the maximal level of glucose during the last year that preceded the time of the point.</p>
<p>This is where virtual tracks come in use.</p>
<p>Virtual track is a named set of rules that describe how the track should be proceeded, and how the time of the iterator point should be modified. Virtual tracks are created by <code>emr_vtrack.create</code> function:</p>

<p>This call creates a new virtual track named <code>annual_glucose</code> based on the underlying physical <em>source track</em> <code>glucose_track</code>. For each iterator point with time <code>T</code> we look at values of <code>glucose_track</code> in the time window of <code>[T-365*24,T]</code>, i.e. one year prior to <code>T</code>. We calculate then the median over the values (<code>func="quantile"</code>, <code>param=0.5</code>).</p>
<p>There is a rich set of various functions besides “quantile” that can be applied to the track values. Some of these functions can be used only with categorical tracks, other ones - only with quantitative tracks and some functions can be applied to both types of the track. Please refer the documentation of <code>emr_vtrack.create</code>.</p>
<p>Once a virtual track is created it can be used in a track expression:</p>

<p><em>Filter</em> is applied to the ID-Time points of the source track (e.g. <code>glucose_track</code> in our example). The virtual track function (<code>quantile</code>, …) is applied then only to the points that pass the filter. The concept of filters is explained extensively in a separate chapter.</p>
<p>Virtual tracks allow also to remap the patient ids. This is done via <code>id.map</code> parameter which accepts a data frame that defines the id mapping. Remapping ids might be useful if family ties are explored. For example, instead of glucose level of the patient we are interested to check the glucose level of one of his family members.</p>

<h3 id="iterators">Iterators<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#iterators"></a>
</h3>
<p>So far we have discussed the track expressions and how they are evaluated given the iterator point. In this section we will show how the iterator points are generated.</p>
<p>An iterator is defined via <code>iterator</code> parameter. There are a few types of iterators such as <em>track iterator</em>, <em>beat iterator</em>, etc. The type determines which points are generated by the iterator. The information about each type is listed below.</p>
<p>Iterator is always accompanied by four additional parameters: <code>stime</code>, <code>etime</code>, <code>keepref</code> and <code>filter</code>. <code>stime</code> and <code>etime</code> bind the time scope of the iterator: the points that the iterator generates lie always within these boundaries. The effect of <code>keepref=TRUE</code> depends on the iterator type. However for all the iterator types if <code>keepref=FALSE</code> the reference of all the iterator points is set to <code>-1</code>. <code>filter</code> parameter sets the iterator filter which is discussed thoroughly later in the document in a separate chapter.</p>
<div class="section level4">

<p><em>Beat Iterator</em> generates a “time beat” at the given period for each id that appear in ‘patients.dob’ track. The period is given always in hours.</p>

<p>This will create a beat iterator with a period of 10 hours starting at <code>stime</code> up until <code>etime</code> is reached. If, for example, <code>stime</code> equals <code>1000</code> then the beat iterator will create for each id iterator points at times: 1000, 1010, 1020, …</p>
<p>If <code>keepref=TRUE</code> for each id-time pair the iterator generates 255 points with references running from <code>0</code> to <code>254</code>. If <code>keepref=FALSE</code> only one point is generated for the given id and time, and its reference is set to <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p><em>Extended beat iterator</em> is as its name suggests a variation on the beat iterator. It works by the same principle of creating time points with the given period however instead of basing the times count on <code>stime</code> it accepts an additional parameter - a track or a <em>Id-Time Points table</em> - that instructs what should be the initial time point for each of the ids. The two parameters (period and mapping) should come in a list. Each id is required to appear only once and if a certain id does not appear at all, it is skipped by the iterator.</p>
<p>Anyhow points that lie outside of <code>[stime, etime]</code> range are not generated.</p>

Without filters we would need to call <code>emr_extract</code> four times, store potentially huge data frame results in the memory and finally merge the tables within R while caring about time windows. With filters we can do it much easier:</p>

<p>We can further expand the example above by specifying the ‘operator’ argument on filter creation. If we wish to extract, the same information as before, but in this case we are interested only in patients which have an hemoglobin level of at least 16 (in addition to our drug treatment requirements). Under the same assumptions in the previous example, our code would look like:</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<p>Filter with logical conditions will use Python’s notation like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1"></a>extract(<span class="st">"hemoglobin"</span>, <span class="bu">filter</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"(filterX or filterY) and not filterZ"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each call to <code>emr_filter.create</code> creates a <em>named elementary filter</em> (or simply: named filter) with a unique name. The named filter can then be used in <code>filter</code> parameter of an iterator and be combined with other named filters using the logical operators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="other-objects-within-filters">Other Objects within Filters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-objects-within-filters"></a>
</h4>
<p>In our previous example we created three named filters based on three tracks. If time window was not required, we could have used the names of the tracks directly in the filter, like: <code>filter = "(drugX | drugY) &amp; !drugZ"</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to track names other types of objects can be used within the filter. These are: <em>Id-Time Points Table</em>, <em>Ids Table</em>, <em>Time Intervals Table</em> and <em>Id-Time Intervals Table</em> (see <em>Appendix</em> for the format of these tables). When used in the filter the object should be constructed in advanced and be referred by its name. “In place” construction (aka: <code>filter = "data.frame(...)"</code> is not allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="managing-reference-in-filters">Managing Reference in Filters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managing-reference-in-filters"></a>
</h4>
<p>The ID-Time Point embeds within itself a reference value. Named filters allow to specify whether the reference should be used for matching or not. When <code>keepref=TRUE</code> is set within <code>emr_filter.create</code>, the candidate point’s reference is matched with the filter’s reference. Otherwise the references are ignored.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that references are always ignored when any object but a named filter is used within a filter. For instance, if <code>filter = "drug"</code> and <code>drug</code> is a name of a track (and not a name of a named filter), then the references will be ignored during the matching. To ensure the filter matches the references of <code>drug</code> track, one must define a named filter with <code>keepref=TRUE</code> parameter:</p>

<p>Various functions in the library such as <code>emr_quantiles</code> make use of pseudo-random number generator. Each time the function is invoked a unique series of random numbers is issued. Hence two identical calls might produce different results. To guarantee reproducible results call <code>set.seed</code> (Python: <code>seed</code>) before invoking the function.</p>
<p>Note: R and Python implementations of Naryn use different pseudo-random number generator algorithms. Sadly it means that the result achieved in R cannot be reproducible in Python if random is used, even if identical seed is shared between the two platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="multitasking">Multitasking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#multitasking"></a>
</h3>
<p>To boost the run time performance various functions in the library support multitasking mode, i.e. parallel computation by several concurrent processes. Multitasking is not invoked immediately: approximately 0.3 seconds from the function launch the actual progress is measured and total run-time is estimated. If the estimated run-time exceeds the limit (currently: 2 seconds), multitasking kicks in.</p>
<p>The number of processes launched in the multitasking mode depends on the total run-time estimation (longer run-time will use more processes) and the values of <code>emr_min.processes</code> and <code>emr_max.processes</code> R options. In any case the number of processes never exceeds the number of CPU cores available.</p>
<p>Multitasking can significantly boost the performance however it utilizes more CPU. When CPU utilization is the priority it is advisable to switch off multitasking by setting <code>emr_multitasking</code> R option to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to increased CPU usage multitasking might also alter the behavior of functions that return ID-Time points such as <code>emr_extract</code> and <code>emr_screen</code>. When multitasking is not invoked these functions return the results always sorted by ID, time and reference. In multitasking mode however the result might come out unsorted. Moreover subsequent calls might return results reshuffled differently. One might use <code>sort</code> parameter in these functions to ensure the points come out sorted. Please bear in mind that sorting the results takes its toll especially on particularly large data frames. That’s why by default <code>sort</code> is set to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
